# D3 version 4.0

https://github.com/d3

semantic versioning? version 4.0 means that it's a major release and not backwards compatible.

why? Remove some warts

How D3 is changing from this monolithic thing instead making it modular.

If you're not making maps, you might not need geo projects.

Lets eliminate the things you don't need

For me it's about having these smaller, decoupled pieces you can understand.

For me, it makes it easier for me to innovate. For example, I no longer have to run tests across the entire library any time I make a change.

There's a D3 organization on Github and there's all of these modules.

d3-arrays, d3-hierarchy, d3-color, etc.

API references are also no longer monolithic.

There will still be a mono-build of all the modules for convenience.

Make it easier to understand and contribute.

To be make to make more breaking changes without breaking your code.

And to create a standard way to create plugins and get them included into the build.

How these modules get combined to produce the bundle at the end:

1. concat all the files together
2. or use rollup.js Similar to browserify or webpack. Takes lots of little javascript files and creates one big javascript file. 

If I'm using d3-color but I'm not using the interpolates, rollup wont include it.

Rollup lets you create a custom build with only the code you need.

Recently working on d3-shape to use the same API for creating SVG or canvas.

If you have hundreds of lines you want to draw, maybe it makes sense to use canvas.

d3-path is setup the same way. I'm trying to use common JS conventions. There's a src/ directory that contains the source code. The difference is that in the new module system, all the source code is written in ES6. I say ES6 in airquotes, it's really just ES5, in the same javascript your browser understands plus the module system. Just the import / export syntax.

If you look at the way d3 was implemented before in v3, we're using this `import` statement syntax from smash. It kind of works but was a bit of a disaster.

Now we're using the ES6 import syntax which is much better.

d3-path

It's just one object that you can all methods on. More of an internal API used by d3-shape but this is now it works under the hood. In the case when using SVG it's using these d3-path commands.

at the top level of all of these modules, there's a `index.js` file that declares all the things that this module exports. See how it's only exporting this single simple that you can then use to serialize these shapes.

If you look at d3-color, it's quite more involved. Larger modules are going to have a larger number of export statements, small modules, fewer.

If you include code directly from these files, that's not supported so your code might break.

But these smaller modules are decoupled from the realize cycle from the main d3 bundle.

It's generally a pain to have generated files your project when lots of other people are contributing so we're not going to do that anymore.

I think in the v3 API there's a d3-color returns the color in it's native color space.

It will be the case that individual modules will be ahead of the default build.

The new build system makes it easier to tie changes and documentation.

I'm mostly interested in the low level stuff. Mainly because it's less controversial. The higher you go, the harder it is to nail down the best abstraction.

I enjoy working on smaller problems. I'm just going to solve this one small problem and that can be just the right way of doing it. My goal for d3 is to be a visualization kernel. To solve the smallest most interesting solution.

If I knew what the right answer was for the high level API, I would tell you and maybe implement that myself but I don't have the answer.

It's not a single page application framework. If you're doing that and d3 dispatch, it can still be pretty complicated.

I expect most people using D3 to go to the main D3 repo if it's a bug report or feature requests but there may be a corresponding issue in the appropriate module repo.

When it's not an issue, but a wish list, a visual paper or something like this. Issues do sort of function as a wish list. There's also the ice box. All the stuff I'm not working on now that might still be useful to work on in the future.

I don't feel like I really need a lot of the functionality. they're non-essential, expect the module syntax.

Half of my bugs are pointer events, the other half our require JS is or is not exporting...

I just want everything to be standardized on ES6 modules. In a few years, when there's wider support for other ES6, I might adopt them.

That's another thing that I like about it. The formating of the comments in the code are preserved.

In the more distant future, hopefully everyone will be using HTTP2, there's no reason to build a bundle. YOu can just use those import statements yourself, the server and be smart and implicitly send you the bundle you need on the fly.

It's really easy to have elements with event listeners with SVG. Every often, what I recommend, is that you use canvas only when you need to use canvas. If you need to do a brush on top of those, use an SVG on top of the canvas. You're just using canvas for the parts that need to be as efficient as possible.
