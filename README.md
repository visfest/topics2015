# topics2015
This is a place to collaborate on session topics for the 2015 d3.unconf. On Saturday morning between breakfast and the keynote we'll use the whiteboards to define the official schedule. This is a place for pre-conference brainstorming. 

Please add [issues](https://github.com/visfest/topics2015/issues) with ideas for sessions, or add notes/comments to issues others have suggested.

For reference, here are [last year's sessions](http://visfest.com/d3unconf2014/).
