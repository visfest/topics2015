# topics2015
This is a place to collaborate on session topics for the 2015 d3.unconf

Please add ideas or comments to the [topic-suggestions.md](https://github.com/visfest/topics2015/blob/master/topic-suggestions.md) file to get the brainstorming started. On Saturday morning, before the 10am keynote, we'll open up the whiteboards and define the sessions. 

For reference, here are [last year's sessions](http://visfest.com/d3unconf2014/).
