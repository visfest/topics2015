# Make it fast

Why is D3 slow? Is it really slow? Or are you trying to show too many data points? The latter is a visualization problem, not a technological one.

The next version of D3, v4, you could use a lot of the features of D3 without the selection. You can use a fake DOM. YOu can use WebGL.
